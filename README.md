This is ProjectFeather public site teaser. 

### Install locally
To develop locally you need NodeJS and GruntJS installed globally. Then:
* clone the gh-pages branch of the feather repo: `git clone -b gh-pages https://github.com/Sitefinity/feather gh-pages`
* run `npm install`
* run `bower install`
* run `grunt` to manually compile the assets 
* to start local server use `node server` and browse the website on `http://localhost:3336`
* if you develop over the js or less files use `grunt watch` for automatic compilation

### Update the Progress Page
* Open json/progress.json with a text editor or a json editor like [JSONedit](http://tomeko.net/software/JSONedit/)
* Make your changes and **preview results** locally
* Commit and push
