To develop locally you need NodeJS and GruntJS installed globally. Then:
* clone the repo `https://github.com/Sitefinity/ProjectFeather`
* run `npm install`
* run `bower install`
* run `grunt` to manually compile the assets 
* to start local server use `node server` and browse the website on `http://localhost:3336`
* if you develop over the js or less files use `grunt watch` for automatic compilation
